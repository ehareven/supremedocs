<p>A quick and easy way to dress up any bed is to add a coordinating bed skirt. The bed skirt, also known as a dust ruffle, serves a practical use by covering up the open areas under the bed and concealing items placed there for storage. It mainly consists of a large, thin piece of inexpensive fabric that is to be placed evenly over the box spring. Most instructions for making bed skirts involve some degree of sewing or hand stitching. Here is a method of making a bed skirt without sewing that will remain in place until you remove it. Allow 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete this project.</p>

<h2>Things You'll Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fabric</li>
<li>9 to 15 Bed skirt pins or upholstery pins</li>
<li>Sharp scissors or fabric shears (if you will be cutting the material yourself)</li>
<li>Measuring tape or a yard stick</li>
<li>Notepad and pencil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Remove your bedding and your mattress from your bed, leaving the box spring in place. Prop up the mattress securely against a wall, or leave it on the floor but out of the way as you work.</li>
 
<li>Measure the distance of the box spring horizontally along the "foot" of your bed. Add 3 inches to this number to determine the width of the material needed for the portion of the bed skirt to be placed there.</li>

<li>Determine length by measuring the vertical distance from the top of the box spring at the foot of your bed down to the floor. Add 3 inches. Purchase one piece of fabric of this length and width.</li>
